# SQL-MAIN-PROJECT
# Library Management System
In the Library Management System Project, your task is to design, implement, and test a relational database system to manage the operations of a library. The system keeps track of essential entities such as branches, employees, books, customers, and the statuses of book issues and returns.

You start by creating a database named library and designing six tables (Branch, Employee, Books, Customer, IssueStatus, and ReturnStatus) with their respective attributes. Each table is structured to handle a specific aspect of library operations. For instance, the Branch table stores information about library branches, Employee manages staff details, Books tracks the books' availability and details, Customer records patron information, and the IssueStatus and ReturnStatus tables handle the transaction history of books being issued and returned.

After defining the schema, you populate the tables with sample data to simulate real-world operations in a library, such as book borrowing, returns, and employee assignments to branches. With this data in place, you write SQL queries to retrieve meaningful insights, such as finding available books, listing employees by salary, tracking issued books, analyzing customer activity, and calculating totals like the number of books per category or employees per branch.

The project concludes with testing all the queries, capturing screenshots of the outputs, and uploading the entire work, including scripts, outputs, and a detailed README file, to a GitHub repository. This provides an end-to-end demonstration of your ability to design, implement, and query a database system, showcasing skills in database management, SQL, and problem-solving for real-world scenarios.
